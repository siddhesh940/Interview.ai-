## 🔢 Quantitative Aptitude

### Topics Covered

| Topic | Questions | Difficulty |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Number System | 10 | Easy-Medium |
| Percentages | 10 | Medium |
| Profit & Loss | 10 | Medium |
| Simple Interest | 10 | Easy-Medium |
| Compound Interest | 10 | Medium |

| Time & Work | 10 | Medium-Hard |
| Time, Speed & Distance | 10 | Medium-Hard |
| Averages | 10 | Easy-Medium |
| Ages | 10 | Medium |

### Topic Details

#### 1. Number System

**Key Concepts:**
- Natural numbers, whole numbers, integers
- Prime and composite numbers
- HCF (Highest Common Factor)
- LCM (Lowest Common Multiple)
- Divisibility rules

**Important Formulas:**

```
HCF × LCM = Product of two numbers
Number of factors of N = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) where N = p^a × q^b × r^c
Sum of first n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2
Sum of first n odd numbers = n²
Sum of first n even numbers = n(n+1)
```

**Shortcuts:**
- Divisibility by 9: Sum of digits divisible by 9
- Divisibility by 11: Alternate sum of digits = 0 or divisible by 11
- Perfect squares end only in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9

**Sample Question:**

```typescript
{
  question: "What is the HCF of 18 and 24?",
  options: { A: "2", B: "3", C: "6", D: "12" },
  correctAnswer: "C",
  explanation: "18 = 2 × 3² and 24 = 2³ × 3. HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6",
  difficulty: "Easy"
}
```

#### 2. Percentages

**Important Formulas:**

```
Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100
Percentage Increase = ((New - Old) / Old) × 100
Percentage Decrease = ((Old - New) / Old) × 100
Successive Percentage: (100+a)(100+b)/100 - 100
```

**Shortcuts:**
- 25% = 1/4, 50% = 1/2, 75% = 3/4
- 33⅓% = 1/3, 66⅔% = 2/3
- 12.5% = 1/8, 20% = 1/5

            How far from the starting point?",
  options: { A: "5 km", B: "6 km", C: "7 km", D: "8 km" },
  correctAnswer: "A",
  explanation: "Using Pythagorean theorem: √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5 km"
}
```
