# ABSTRACT

The increasing complexity of modern job markets and rapidly evolving skill requirements have created significant challenges for job seekers in effectively preparing for interviews and understanding their career readiness. Traditional career guidance methods often lack personalized insights and fail to provide actionable feedback on specific skill gaps or role compatibility. Although various online platforms offer interview tips and resume templates, existing solutions fall short when applied to comprehensive skill extraction, personalized feedback generation, and realistic career trajectory analysis. To address these shortfalls, this study presents a comprehensive system designed for automated resume analysis, interview simulation, and structured career assessment. The system processes user-submitted resumes to extract relevant technical skills, work experience, educational qualifications, and project details, subsequently analyzing this information against target role requirements. Through systematic evaluation methods, the platform identifies skill deficiencies, provides targeted improvement recommendations, and generates realistic career progression insights based on current market trends. Interview simulation components offer users practice opportunities with structured feedback mechanisms covering communication skills, technical knowledge, and behavioral responses. The platform incorporates gamified learning modules including aptitude training and soft skills development to enhance user engagement during the preparation process. Additionally, company-specific preparation resources tailored to major recruiters are provided along with real-time placement drive tracking. Through the utilization of structured data processing and pattern matching techniques, the system enhances candidate awareness, significantly reducing preparation time and improving interview success rates. The implementation of this system aims to improve role readiness assessment accuracy, optimize preparation resource utilization, and allow for data-driven decision-making in career planning. Evaluation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in providing meaningful career guidance with practical value for educational institutions, career counseling services, and individual job seekers.
